## v2.1 March-12-2018
Completed the first page design, moving onto the second and the third, and still debating between having a one page or multiple page would be a good idea without the help of modules. However, the advantage of having a one-page is the loading speed as nothing has to be loaded from the beginning.

Also debating between manipulating the template style with a seperate sheet of css or using a class to manipulate the style.
