[Trello To-Do list](https://trello.com/c/a2vtr4ha/24-to-do)

## v.2.2 March-13-2018
Comparing to the last version, this is by far the most up-to-date version with responsiveness and interaction embedded. So far, the basic structure of the website is done, leaving the interaction and the optimization to be improved in the future.

### Added
    - JSON, added a uniqueID tag for each project for target locating (because of lack of dynamic search-matching mechanism)
    - Adding emoji
    - Adding emoji replacement interaction
    - Link of mail-to while clicking on the mailbox emoji
    - Viewport breakpoint
    - Viewport responsive layout (CSS)
    - animate scrollTop for all the "project box" clicks

### Pending
    - Intro sentence js typing simulation animation

## v2.1 March-12-2018
Completed the first page design, moving onto the second and the third, and still debating between having a one page or multiple page would be a good idea without the help of modules. However, the advantage of having a one-page is the loading speed as nothing has to be loaded from the beginning.

Also debating between manipulating the template style with a seperate sheet of css or using a class to manipulate the style.
### Added
    - content.json for recording most of the content for the site for the purpose of reusability
